known bugs right now:
1. need to remove conflict file, ex: /usr/include/libintl.h
2. need to link from /bin/* - /usr/bin*
3. not found package eventhough package already install: ex: gperf, elfutil
4. cannot compile eudev from script and need to compile by hand
5. cannot compile runit-bootscript from script which mean i have to chroot into ROOTFS and build it.
6. same goes to Kernel also, reason maybe ELFUTIL|Libelf
7. after going to build kernel i found another error: sed and grep is not in /usr/bin/
